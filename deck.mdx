## A little background

<ListLayout>
  <ul>
    <Appear>
      <li>Much our our API's are dependent on other remote services</li>
      <li>Remote services can fail or hang</li>
      <li>Many unresponsive services can lead to failure in multiple systems</li>
    </Appear>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <Notes>
      <li>Software running in other processes and probably other computers</li>
      <li>
        Unlike in-memory calls, remote calls can fail, or hang without response,
        leading to detriment of user experience
      </li>
      <li>
        Dependent Services can run out or resources leading to cascading failures
        across multiple systems
      </li>
    </Notes>
  </ul>
</ListLayout>

---

## Expected behavior...

<ListLayout>
  <ul>
    <Appear>
      <li>A failure in a service dependency should not break the user experience for members</li>
      <li>Our system should automatically take corrective action when one of its service dependencies fails</li>
    </Appear>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <Notes>
      <li>What are our thresholds for error?</li>
      <li>We should provide fallback functionality</li>
    </Notes>
  </ul>
</ListLayout>

## Enter the circuit breaker

<ListLayout>
  <ul>
    <Appear>
      <li>Custom fallback</li>
      <li>Fail fast</li>
      <li>Don‚Äôt crash</li>
      <li>Heal automatic</li>
    </Appear>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <Notes>
      <li>
        Try to get the same data from some other source. If not possible, use its own cache value.
      </li>
      <li>
        If serviceA knows that serviceB is down, there is no point waiting for
        the timeout and consuming its own resources. It should return ASAP ‚Äúknowing‚Äù that serviceB is down
      </li>
      <li>As we saw in this case, serviceA should not have crashed.</li>
      <li>Periodically check if serviceB is working again.</li>
      <li>All other APIs should continue to work.</li>
    </Notes>
  </ul>
</ListLayout>

## How does it work?

<div>
  <div style="background: white">
    <img src={CircuitBreakerImg} />
  </div>
  <ul>
    <Notes>
      <li>
        In the normal closed state the operations are as usual:
        if a call succeeds nothing happens, if it fails, the circuit
        breaker makes a note of the failure, once this number exceeds a threshold
        the circuit breaker opens.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the circuit is open calls to the circuit breaker will fail immediately or
        it will return the fallback
      </li>
      <li>
        After some time the Circuit Breaker will attempt to reset, so it goes into half
        open state, attempts to make the call if it succeeds it resets if not it keeps the
        circuit open.
      </li>
      <li>It makes periodic calls to check the health of a service.</li>
    </Notes>
  </ul>
</div>
